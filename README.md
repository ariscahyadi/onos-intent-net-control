# ONOS Intent-leveraged Networking Control Application

ONOS intent-leveraged networking control application is designed to apply a recommended policy for a specific type of flow that received from flow-centric visibility into ONOS intent specification. For flow with ‘forward’ policy, it keeps related intent configuration with the proper device and ingress/egress port number where the flow is received/sent. ‘Redirect’ policy is applied into ‘point-to-point’ intent with specific ingress port where flows are coming, and egress port for further inspection or temporarily stored. Then, ‘blocking’ policy is applied to ‘point-to-point’ intent with specialized instruction in the intent’s instruction as a drop action. The critical piece of our design is an intent-leveraged application which needs to be implemented as part of the ONOS SDN controller application. It receives/queries input from/to flow-centric visibility that contains a specific source of subnet address and its recommended policy.
